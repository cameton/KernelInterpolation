# PDKernels
The aim of this package is three-fold:
1. Provide a number of positive definite and conditionally positive definite kernels, with an interface consistent to that of packages such as [Distances.jl][1] or [Distributions.jl][2].
2. Provide tools for constructing an interpolant given evaluations of a function. For large datasets, techniques for computing an approximate interpolant are available.
3. Provide tools for hyperparameter selection and performance evaluation of kernel interpolants.

**TODO** Expand README with list of supported functions/interpolants and provide benchmarks
